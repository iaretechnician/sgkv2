V. 1.1 (this only refers to the UE4 marketplace version)

You can save resources by creating "instances" of pieces that you plan on repeating and using those in your project.

Passenger car might not fit properly on the smaller tighter curve depending on your track setup.

 Trucks/bogies/wheels are separate meshes to allow proper placement on curves.

   Track is intended to be placed with ties sunk into terrain in most cases.

You can change the colors of some of the cars by going into materiallayering/shader folder and selecting the appropriate instance and altering the "mat1_color" or changing the "txt_mat1_base" texture.

   There is a rail joiner provided for decoration. These are normally used to connect rails together about every 40 feet and staggered and thus are separate from the track meshes (since the track meshes are cut evenly) so you can put them in prototypical locations.

Some suggestions...

Delete random ties (and plates) of the track (may need 3d program import/export for this cusomization)

Use the passenger car repeatedly to make up a passenger train.

Repeat the locomotive to make up a consist.

Change angle of track pieces in an attempt to get that "wavy" rail look. (haven't attempted this myself, just an idea).
